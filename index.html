                Hello, I am a beginner when it comes to coding with html, and css. However, I am someone that tries to
                obtain as much knowledge as I can from different perspectives. When it comes to coding I've had a fond
                of it since I was in college, but however being from a old school family style. My parents saw this as
                just a waste of time. However as time went on I tried to purse the career that I had wanted to, but I 
                would always fall back into a loop. Thus, when I found out my work would support me on attending this 
                course I without a doubt said let;s gives this another shot, but stick to it. I'm excited for this new 
                adventure that I'm taking, and by the looks of it it seems that I'm not the only one that's taking that
                path. Here I am taking it one step at a time. <!--continue later on with the story-->
