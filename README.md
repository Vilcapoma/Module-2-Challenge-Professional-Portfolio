CSS Git Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Description
In this homework assignment I ended up creating a outline on how I wanted to creat this professional portfolio.
It did take a while for me to understand on how each element section has its own affect on the page when I add a style to it in the css file.
Even though it was challenging, but I see it as heading into the right direction.
